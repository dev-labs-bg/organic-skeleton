## Configure mongodb
* Replace "organic-skeleton-db/organic-skeleton-test-db" with your db name for _development, _production and _test environments.
** In secrets.json files
** In processes/index.json files
Keep in mind it's a good idea to use different db for tests, since it will be wiped out every time you run them.
